**Final Project - Flight Reservation**

Create a flight reservation system for a single airline that allows users to search for and shop for flights.

Like any flight reservation, the user should be able to customize the following options before getting a list of search results:

 - Round-trip vs. One-way
 - Number of flight passengers
 - Class (Economy, First, Business)
 - From destination
 - To destination
 - Date flying out
 - Date returning
 
 **Flight results displayed should include:**

 - The destination
 - The flight duration
 - The date and time of the flight
 - The cost per passenger of the flight
 - Legs of the trip should be displayed separately. The user should have the option of selecting a departing flight and return flight, each with its own price.

Users can either log into their account to shop for a flight or create an account upon checking out. Users should be able to see a list of their flight history when logged into their accounts.

**A single user in the system should have:**

 - A first and last name
 - Their birth date
 - Their country of citizenship
 - Email
 - Phone
 
After the user checks out, generate a boarding pass with their flight information and user information stored in a QR code.

Admins can add flights to the system.

You must collaborate on GitHub. Coordinate accordingly so you avoid merge conflicts.

You shall be presenting your final project on the last day. You will be showing the application as it is published on Heroku. You will have 25 minutes to present it.

Each person in the group must speak during that time.
