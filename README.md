This project is a flight reservation website for a single airline that allows users to search for and shop for flights.

Like any flight reservation, the user is able to customize the following options before getting a list of search results:

 - Round-trip vs. One-way
 - Number of flight passengers
 - Class (Economy, First, Business)
 - From destination
 - To destination
 - Date flying out
 - Date returning
 
 **Flight results displayed should include:**

 - The destination
 - The flight duration
 - The date and time of the flight
 - The cost per passenger of the flight
 - Legs of the trip should be displayed separately. The user should have the option of selecting a departing flight and return flight, each with its own price.

Users can either log into their account to shop for a flight or create an account upon checking out. Users should be able to see a list of their flight history when logged into their accounts.

**A single user in the system should have:**

 - A first and last name
 - Their birth date
 - Their country of citizenship
 - Email
 - Phone
 
After the user checks out, generate a boarding pass with their flight information and user information stored in a QR code.

Admins can add flights to the system.
